					Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly
					10 years ago, Iâ€™ve done remote work for agencies, consulted
					for startups, and collaborated with talented people to
					create web products for both business and consumer use.
					<br />
					<br /> I create successful responsive websites that are
					fast, easy to use, and built with best practices. The main
					area of my expertise is front-end development, HTML, CSS,
					JS, building small and medium web apps, custom plugins,
					features, animations, and coding interactive layouts.
					<br />
					<br /> I also have full-stack developer experience with
					popular open-source CMS like (WordPress, Drupal, Magento,
					Keystone.js and others) . Visit my LinkedIn profile for more
					details or just contact me.
